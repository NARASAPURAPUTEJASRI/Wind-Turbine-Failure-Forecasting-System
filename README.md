                                         Summary

The predictive maintenance system for wind turbines leverages Supervised Random Forest for operational reliability, offering interpretable risk probabilities, minimizing false alarms, and enabling early interventions. Unsupervised clustering further enhances the system by detecting unusual patterns in SCADA data that may not yet be labeled as failures. This combination ensures robust and proactive maintenance planning.

The system can be extended for interactive use, allowing operators to upload weekly or monthly SCADA data for immediate safety assessments and actionable insights.
